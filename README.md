For Milestone 1: 
The flow of the application a user will experience by now is that once the
 user starts the application, he will be required to login with his
 credentials-stored at firebase database- if exist. Otherwise, he needs to
 go to the registration page. Once the user is authenticated, a page-home page- 
 with 2 buttons is displayed, one for the personal profile
 page of this user which contains his info and it will have a view to add
 extra data to the signed user. The other button redirects the user to the
 map view page to see the location of the GUC clinic and drug stores
 available across the campus. The user can return from the profile and
 the map pages to the home page easily.
For Milestones 2 and 3:
 The flow of the application a user will experience by now is that once the
 user starts the application, he will be required to login with his
 credentials-stored at firebase database- if exists. Otherwise, he needs
 to go to the registration page. Once the user is authenticated, according
 to the type of that user (patient or doctor) a page-home page- is
 displayed. In the case of a patient, he can show the medications
 available in the drug stores, raise or check medical requests, and
 proceed to buy medications. In the case of a doctor, he can add, edit,
 delete and view medications. The doctor can also check any requested
 approval or consultation. Each user has a personal profile page which
 contains his information (user name, mail , hidden password, type of
 user, and gender) and allows the user to edit. A patient can make a
 voice over IP call with an active doctor. Also worked more on the UI,
 Network Scanning and Network Sniffing
